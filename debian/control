Description: converts the output of scp into machine-readable format 
 scpwrap wraps the scp command such that the output generated
 by that command is converted into a format more easily processed 
 by other commands.
 .
 scp(1) progress information is captured and converted into a 
 machine-readable format for use in more sophisticated user 
 interfaces (which in turn would require even more effort to turn 
 back into a machine-readable format). And so the circle of life
 continues.
